# Rainfall-Prediction-Using-Random-Forest
 This project predicts whether rainfall will occur using historical weather data and a Random Forest machine learning model.
# Project Description
The goal of this project is to build a binary classification model that predicts rainfall (Rain / No Rain) based on meteorological features such as pressure, humidity, cloud cover, sunshine, and wind conditions.
Class imbalance in the dataset is handled using downsampling to improve model reliability.
# Model Used
Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
Problem Type: Binary Classification
Target Variable: rainfall
1 → Rain
0 → No Rain
# Features
